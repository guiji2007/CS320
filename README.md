Software Test

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my product is functional, first of all, I conduct the analysis of user requirements and develop the code based on those requirements. In the testing phase, I rely on JUnit test coverage report. I set the acceptance standard to be 90%. Software security is one of the areas that require the developer to exert extra cautions. I would ensure that the version of the java framework is up-to-date and the dependecy report shows no vulnerabilities. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Translating user stories into technical requirements of a product requires experience, especially if the project become more complexed. I conduct the analysis by  reading user requirements, decide if those requirements can be accomplished in any technical ways, and then finally sketch the blueprint of how to turn those requirements into the code. 


How do I approach designing software?
My apporach to design software is quite simple. Start with user requirement analysis. Based on the analysis, I design the main framework of the software, including creating objects and methods and choose the right data structure to fulfill the requirements. In the process of actual coding, if I don't remember using certain java functions, I will do some research and find the correct way to develop the functions. Lastly, I implement the Unit Test to ensure that test coverage is at a satsifactory level.
